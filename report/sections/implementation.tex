\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}

This work is accompanied with an implementation of the proposed method in Python \footnote{https://github.com/saeedghsh/subdivision/}.

%% Note:
%% the use of bezier curves for face's path representation is an approximation of the provided curves.
%% This approximation affects both the decomposition (over the area of a face) and accuracy of the point-face localization.
%% Is there any better approach to this approaximation? 

%% Note:
%% faces and holes both belong to face class, but they differ by the direction of their path: 
%% face.path == CCW
%% hole.path == CW
